    "In this notebook, we demonstrate the use of [Llama3-8B](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b) text generation combined with [Amazon Titan Embedding v2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-parameters-titan-embed-text.html) embedding model to efficiently construct a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) QnA system on a SageMaker Notebook. This notebook, powered by an `ml.t3.medium instance`, uses LLMs deployed on [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/what-is-bedrock.html). These can be called with an API, which we then use to build, experiment with, and tune for comparing Advanced RAG application techniques using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/). Additionally, we showcase how the [FAISS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/faiss) Embedding store can be utilized to archive and retrieve embeddings, integrating it into your RAG workflow. "

Also, if you want to control how many relevant documents should be retrieved then change the `k` parameter in the cell below to see different outputs. In many scenarios you might want to know which were the source documents that the LLM used to generate the answer, you can get those documents in the output using `return_source_documents` which returns the documents that are added to the context of the LLM prompt. `RetrievalQA` also allows you to provide a custom [prompt template](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/quick_start/) which can be specific to the model.\n",

When working with document retrieval, you may encounter a trade-off between storing small chunks of a document for accurate embeddings and larger documents to preserve more context. The `ParentDocumentRetriever` strikes that balance by splitting and storing small chunks of data. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, a `parent_splitter` is used to divide the original documents into larger chunks called `parent documents.` These parent documents can preserve a reasonable amount of context so the LLM can.\n",

    "Next, a `child_splitter` is applied to create smaller `child documents` from the original documents. These child documents allow the embeddings to reflect more accurately their meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The child documents are then indexed in a vectorstore using embeddings. This enables efficient retrieval of relevant child documents based on similarity.\n",

    "The `ParentDocumentRetriever` uses an [InMemoryStore](https://api.python.langchain.com/en/v0.1.4/storage/langchain.storage.in_memory.InMemoryBaseStore.html) to store and manage the parent documents. By working with both parent and child documents, this approach aims to balance accurate embeddings with contextual information, providing more meaningful and relevant retrieval results."

    "Congratulations on completing the advanced retrieval augmented generation with `Llama3 8b`! These are important techniques that combines the power of large language models with the precision of retrieval methods. Upon comparing these different techniques, we are able to see that in contexts like detailing AWS’s transition from a simple service to a complex, multi-billion-dollar entity, or explaining Amazon's strategic successes, the Regular Retriever Chain lacks the precision the more sophisticated techniques offer, leading to less targeted information. While there are quite few differences visible between the Advanced techniques discussed, they are far and away more informative than Regular Retriever Chains. For customers in industries such as HCLS, Telecommunications, and FSI who are looking to implement RAG in their applications,  the limitations of the Regular Retriever Chain in providing precision, avoiding redundancy, and effectively compressing information make them less suited to fulfilling these needs compared to the more advanced Parent Document Retriever and Contextual Compression techniques, that are able to distill the vast amounts of information into the concentrated, impactful insights that customers need, while helping improve price performance."
