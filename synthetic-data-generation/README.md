## **Introduction**
In this notebook, we explore how to utilize Llama 3.1 405B to create high-quality, concise training data for fine-tuning smaller models. This approach enhances the performance of smaller models by leveraging the strengths of a larger model.

## **Setup and Configuration**
We start by setting up the necessary environment, including installing required libraries and configuring the SageMaker session. This section also covers how to load the Llama 3.1 405B model and prepare it for data generation.

## **Data Preparation**
In this section, we generate synthetic data using Llama 3.1 405B. The notebook includes functions to create instructional prompts and corresponding outputs, ensuring the generated data is diverse and suitable for fine-tuning.

## **Fine-Tuning Llama 3 8B**
Here, we demonstrate how to fine-tune the smaller Llama 3 8B model using the prepared dataset. This section includes setting up the training parameters, preparing the dataset, and running the fine-tuning process.

## **Evaluation and Validation**
After fine-tuning, we evaluate the performance of the Llama 3 8B model. This section covers methods to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness, including generating evaluation reports.

## **Conclusion**
The notebook concludes with a summary of the process and highlights the benefits of using a larger model to prepare datasets for fine-tuning smaller models. We also discuss potential future developments and applications of this approach.
